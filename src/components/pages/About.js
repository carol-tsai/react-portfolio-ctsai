            Hello, my  name is Carol Tsai. I was born and raised in Mission  Viejo, California, but I moved to Philadelphia
            in the summer of 2021. I studied Environmental
            Sciences at UC Berkeley and graduated in 2020 with a minor in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). After that I worked as a GIS contractor for
            Apple Maps for over a year.

            I was first introduced to coding through some computer science classes I took in college. Although I
            initially only took these classes to learn a new skill on the side, it quickly became a new mindset that I
            gained for how to approach problems and find solutions in much of life. In my early career I began using some of my python
            knowledge to write simple automation scipts for my team. I saw that coding could have so many more applications
            and I wanted to learn more, so I decided to become a web developper. Here I would like to present some projects that I have worked
            since the start of my new journey.
